            <p class="lead">I have lots of practical knowledge with HTML5, CSS3 as well as working with the Bootstrap framework. I'm also working on gaining more experience with both JavaScript and jQuery. My most recent work includes building a <strong>demo web app</strong> for PocketAnatomy.<br>
                My main programming language is Java, but I am also familiar with C and Python with Django. I have class assignments available for viewing <strong>here on GitHub</strong> as well as my 2nd year Django project, Hipstergram, available <strong><a href="http://hipstergram-aisling.rhcloud.com/">here</a></strong>.
                <br>
                I have a solid knowledge of software development and experience with project management. I have practice working as part of a team but yet am independant when left to my own devices.
                <br>
                I am also familiar with using Git Shell, and all projects and code on this site can be found on my GitHub page <strong>here!</strong>
